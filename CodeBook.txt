
Assign each data to variables

Features <- features.txt 
Activities <- activity_labels.txt 
Subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt 
x_test <- test/X_test.txt 
y_test <- test/y_test.txt 
Subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt
x_train <- test/X_train.txt
y_train <- test/y_train.txt

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
X is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
Y is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
Subject is created by merging Subject_train and Subject_test using rbind() function
Merged_Data is created by merging Subject, Y and X using cbind() function

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
Tidy_data is created by subsetting Merged_Data, selecting columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement

Entire numbers in code column of the TidyData replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable

Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
code column in TidyData renamed into activities
All Acc replaced by Accelerometer
All Gyro replaced by Gyroscope
All BodyBody replaced by Body
All Mag replaced by Magnitude
All start with character f replaced by Frequency
All start with character t replaced by Time

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
Final_data (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing TidyData taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.
Export Final_data into FinalData.txt file.
